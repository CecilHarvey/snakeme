SnakeMe tools
=============

This directory contain the windows version of my Sprite Editor
used to produce all SnakeMe graphics.
As long as all source code for coding and decoding such sprites
are included in the SGU library, I don't release the source code
of SpriteED, because it is too ugly :-¦ But if someone is interested,
I will give it to her of course ;-)
