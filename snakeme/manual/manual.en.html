<h3>Introduction :</h3>

<p>The basic rules are very simple, there's a snake which has to eat apples in order to grow and win points.
  You can already find this game on many mobile phones and other shareware or freeware.</p>

<p>So, what is new and unique in SnakeMe?</p>

<p>First of all, it's a nice game with beautiful colors, and a very ergonomic interface.</p>

<p>It's possible to play alone or with up to three other human players. But there is no need of one computer
  for each player: it's possible to put two players on the same keyboard, and the two other players can play
  on joypads if there are some. A game can have a maximum of eight players, so for example, if you're two
  human players, it possible to add up to 6 computer players (AI).</p>

<p>There is also a weapon, but be careful: there are not much munitions and you have to collect them.</p>

<p>SnakeMe is a completely configurable game: you can choose your levels, your snakes and the appearance you
  wish to apply to the chosen levels. It's also possible to create your own levels thanks to a very easy to
  use level editor. If you wish to design new snakes or level themes, that's possible too with the small
  application Sprite Editor supplied with SnakeMe. Of course, you can also download more

<a name="game"><hr width="100%" align="center" size="2" color="#0000FF">

<a name="game.main"><h3>Main Menu :</h3>

<p align="center"><img src="images/mainmenu.gif" width="640" height="480"></p>

<p>There are 5 buttons :</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Game :</b><br>
    Lets you play SnakeMe.
  <li><b>Controls :</b><br>
    Lets you customize the keys with which you will play.

</ul>

<a name="game.setup"><h3>Game Setup :</h3>

<p align="center"><img src="images/gamesetup.gif" width="640" height="480"></p>

<p>There are 3 different sections in this screen :</p>

<p>First, on top, you can choose the level (at left) and game theme (at right). Use the
arrows to change your selection. You can play any level with any theme.</p>

<p>Then, in the middle, there are 8 player configuration boxes. Each box lets you :

<ul>
  <li>Activate and inactivate the player, this is done with the green/red button.
    Green is activated, red is deactivated.
  <li>Enter the player name, this is done by using the text input field.
  <li>Choose the control mode, by clicking on the arrow picture.
    With 4 arrows, you control the snake in absolute mode, i.e. relative to the screen.
    With 2 arrows, you control the snake in relative mode, i.e. relative to the snake.
  <li>Choose the player control, by clicking on the A, B, AI, A joy, B joy picture.
    In A mode, controls A are used. In B mode, controls B are used.
    You can configure the control keys in the controls section.
    For going to the controls section, click on the controls button on the bottom of the screen.
    In AI mode, an artificial intelligence (AI) controls the snake.
    In A joystick or B joystick (if available), you control the snake with the first, or second joystick.
  <li>Choose the snake. Click on the arrow to select the snake.
</ul>

<p>Third, on the bottom, you can either return to main menu (Cancel button), start the
game (Play button), configure control (Controls button), or go to the advanced options (Advanced
Setup button) (see below).</p>


<a name="game.play"><h3>Play :</h3>

<p align="center"><img src="images/play.gif" width="640" height="480"></p>

<p>On the top of the screen, you can see the different snakes that are playing, their names and
  their points. If a snake has collected bonus, a little blue bar appears under it's name. The
  longer the bar is the more bullets he has collected.</p>

<p>When a snake reaches the number of points to win, the game is finished, and a screen appears
  with the score of each snake. If you wish to finish the game before a winner has been declared,
  type the ESC key.</p>

<p>The way points are counted is defined in the advanced setup. You win points when you eat a meal
  bonus, when you throw a bullet in another snake, and when a snake crashes into your snake. You
  loose points when your snake gets cut by a bullet, and when your snake crashes into something.</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>

<a name="game.controls"><h3>Controls :</h3>

<p align="center"><img src="images/controls.gif" width="640" height="480"></p>

<p>Here you can change the key for snake control. Click on a key, then enter the new key.</p>

<p>There are two ways to control your snake: with the absolute keys or with the relative keys.
  With the absolute keys, if you push for instance the key chosen for "Absolute left", your snake
  will go to the left. But with the relative keys, if you push the key chosen for "Relative left",
  your snake will turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. In the "Game Setup" screen, there is a button
  where you can switch between absolute and relative mode.</p>

<p>The action button is used to fire the bullets you have collected in the game</p>

<a name="game.advanced"><h3>Advanced Setup :</h3>

<p align="center"><img src="images/advancedsetup.gif" width="640" height="480"></p>

<p>Here you can change advanced options for the game. With this, you can personalize the
game-play, and have even more fun. Just move the bar to adjust your desired settings.</p>

<p>Here's a little explanation for each setting :</p>

<ul>

</ul>
    
<a name="game.leveled"><h3>Level Editor :</h3>

<p align="center"><img src="images/leveleditor.gif" width="640" height="480"></p>

<p>Here you can edit a level. This editor is very easy to use, just as a paint program.</p>

<p>First of all, you have to know that on the top right, there is a little help text that
  appears if you put your mouse over a button.</p>

<p>On the top left there are six buttons :</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Exit</b><br>
    Exits the level editor and returns to the game. If your level has not been saved, it asks you if you want to save it or not.
  <li><b>Load</b><br>
    Loads an existing level, so you can edit any existing level.
  <li><b>New</b><br>
    Creates a blank level.
  <li><b>Save</b><br>
    Allows you to save your level. If type the name of an existing level (or you click on an
    existing level), your theme will overwrite the other level without prompting.
  <li><b>Theme</b><br>
    Allows you to see what your level looks like with the chosen theme. But the chosen theme
    will not be attributed with your level: it will always be possible to play every level
    with every theme.
  <li><b>Undo</b><br>
    Allows you to un-do one action (and only one).
</ul>

<p>On the top middle, there are four drawing tools: the first draws points, the second draws
  lines, the third draws rectangles, and the last fills the given zone.</p>

<p>And on the top right, you can choose what you want to draw (nothing, an indestructible wall,
  or a destructible wall).</p>
